## What is it?

Nightingale is a project for the Discord Hack Week. We wanna make a "Emotion support" bot. What does this mean? Literally we are making a emotional detector on chat for user support (if the user is sad, suicidal, happy, etc.). Also, the bot will have a complete set of skills.

###### We wanna cover all (or at least) the categories the hack week gives:

* Productivity
  * FAQ
  * Discord General Help
  * Creation of Roles/Channels
* Entertainment
  * Api calls
  * Music
  * SoundBoard
* Shitpost
  * Roleplay
  * Image manipulation
* Moderation
  * User Mute
  * Spam Detection
  * Auto-Moderation
* Social
  * IA
  * Emotions Detectors
  * Conversations with the users.

## Architecture

Nightingale will use Discord.PY in first intance. *Wip*
